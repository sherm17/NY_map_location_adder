# NY_map_location_adder

This is a simple full stack application that allows the user to add point locations to the map. 
Initial point data is fetched from a MySQL database and displayed on the map.
The user can then enter more information to add additional points to the map.

The techologies used in this application are 
- Leaflet library 
- Mapquest API
- NodeJS
- MySQL

I was inspired to create this application when my friends and I planned a trip to new york and we 
wanted a way to see all the places we wanted to go to relative to each other, while also having the ability to add new points
